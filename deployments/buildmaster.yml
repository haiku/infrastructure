#
# Haiku buildmaster
#
# Runs buildmasters which connect to various builders
# at various remote locations over ssh with verifie
# host keys.
#
# TODO: buildmaster-packages-pvc is a strain on our
# infrastructure. We really need to get it to
# S3,Storj,etc "somehow". Given the difficulty of RWX
# mixed with the size of these volumes, all of these
# have to run on the same node reducing redundancy.
#
# We choose do-block-storage-retain as a storage class
# to "retain" PV's if this deployment is accidently
# deleted. In theory we could create a volume snapshot
# of the unattached volume and restore it to a new
# PVC via kubernetes.
